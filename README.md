# Fibonacci Sequence

## Project structure
- `lib/fibonacci.rb`  - contains solution
  - a method called recursive_fib solves this problem by using a recursive solution. 
  - a method called iterative_fib solves this problem by using an iterative solution. 

- `spec/fibonacci_spec.rb` - tests on methods and time performance
  - The ruby Benchmark module is used to test the time difference for both solutions

## Test execution
- Run `bundle install`
- Open terminal window
- From the project directory run `rspec`
